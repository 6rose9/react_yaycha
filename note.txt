/** Context Provider

 *  What
 *  passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level, 
 *  sharing data/state across components
 * 
 *  Why 
 *  to avoid prop drilling
 *  to make global state easily accessible
 *  
 *  When should use
 *  global data/state that many components need (like user info, theme, language, authentication, etc.)
 *  
 *  How 
 *  createContext() → makes a Context object.
 *  .Provider → wraps components and provides a value (state, functions, etc.)
 *  useContext() → lets any component read that value directly, without passing props down
